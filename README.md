# Levenshtein-Distance
In this implementation, the levenshtein_distance function takes two strings s1 and s2 as input and returns the Levenshtein distance between them. The function uses a 2D dynamic programming table dp to store the edit distances between all possible prefixes of s1 and s2. The final distance is stored in dp[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of s1 and s2, respectively.
